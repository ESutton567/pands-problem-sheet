## Project Descripton

My name is **Ã‰ilis Sutton** and I would like to welcome you to my first foray into programming. 

Below you will find a list of weekly tasks that I have completed ***in python*** as part of my course in the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) **Higher Diploma in Computing in Data Analytics**

Within this ReadMe I will cover programs that:
- Calculate BMI *(week 2)*
- Ask a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order *(week 3)*
- Run the collatz conjecture *(week 4*)
- Output whether or not today is a weekday *(week 5*)
- Takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root without using built in functions *(week 6*)
- Read in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains *(week 7*)
- Display a plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes *(week 8*)
