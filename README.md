## Project Descripton

My name is **Ã‰ilis Sutton** and I would like to welcome you to my first foray into programming. 

Below you will find a list of weekly tasks that I have completed ***in python*** as part of my course in the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) **Higher Diploma in Computing in Data Analytics**

---
Suggested tools to run these programs:
* [Visual Studio Code (VSC)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
* [Python 3.8 or higher](https://www.python.org/)

Within this ReadMe I will cover programs that:
- Calculate BMI *(week 2)*
- Ask a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order *(week 3)*
- Run the collatz conjecture *(week 4*)
- Output whether or not today is a weekday *(week 5*)
- Takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root without using built in functions *(week 6*)
- Read in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains *(week 7*)
- Display a plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes *(week 8*)

## 2. Statements

This week's topic explored creating simple programs using statements.

The weekly task was to write a program to calculate a user's Body Mass Index (BMI)

#### **BMI.py**

* This program begins by asking the user to input their weight in kilograms (kg), following by their height in centimetres (cm). 
* It then creates a new variable that calculates BMI (weight[kg]/height[m<sup>2</sup>]), based on the user input values. 
* Finally it prints out the resulting BMI value<sup>1.

~~~python
# ask the user to input their weight
weight = int(input("Please enter your weight (kg):"))
# ask the user to input their height
height = int(input("Please enter your height (cm):"))
# create a variable that calculates BMI as per the formula
newNumber = weight/((height/100)**2)
# output the variable based on the user input
print('The BMI is kg/m2: {}' .format (newNumber))

## 3. Variables

This week explored the topic of variables.

The weekly task was to write a program that takes string inputted by the user and outputs every second letter in reverse order 

#### **secondstring.py**

* This program begins by asking the user to input a sentance (argument). 
* It then slices the inputted argument to every other character of the input argument from index 0 (0 being the first character) to the end ([::2]<sup>1) 
* To retrieve these characters in reverse order add a minus in to [::2] -> [::-2]<sup>2 
* Finally it prints out the resulting message.

~~~python
# ask the user to enter a sentance
# slice the argument to every 2nd element, and reverse it
message = input("Please enter a sentance: ")[::-2] 
# print the message
print(message)

## 4. Controlling the flow

This week explored flow control: assigning conditions to statements and implementing iterations using 'for' loops and 'while' loops.

The weekly task was to run the Collatz Conjecture on a user input value.

The [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture):
>"...in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one. It concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1."

#### **collatz.py**

* This program begins by creating a function to run the Collatz Conjecture<sup>1</sup>. A conditional statement is applied that if the argument (number) is even then it is to be divided by 2. If the number is not even, i.e. it is odd, then the number will be multipled by 3 and a 1 subsequently added. 
* The user is asked to enter an integer which is run through the collatzz function
* The output of this is then printed and reentered back into the function to run repeatedly until the the function outputs a value of 1 (using a while loop). 
* When the function returns an output of 1, the program will be terminated<sup>2</sup>

~~~python
# create function for collatz conjecture
def collatz(number):  
    # if the argument is even                
    if number % 2 == 0: 
        # print argument value divided by 2              
        print(number // 2) 
        # call function to divide argument value by 2           
        return number // 2            
    
    # If the number is odd
    elif number % 2 == 1: 
            # print the argument multipled by 3 first then add 1 to this            
            result = ((3*number) +1)  
            # print input argument divided by 2
            print(result)             
            # call function to multiple input argument by 3, then add one
            return result             
           
numberInput = int(input("Please enter a positive integer: "))
# keep rerunning the function until the argument passed into the function equals 0
while numberInput != 1:               
    # pass the argument value into the collatz function
    numberInput = collatz(numberInput)
else: 
    numberInput == 1
    # quit the program when a specific output value returns back into the function
    quit()

## 5. Data

This week explored data structures including:
- lists
- tuples
- dictionaries

The weekly task was to create a program that outputs whether the current day is a weekday or not.

#### **weekday.py**

* This program uses an in-built module of Python called datatime, which supplies classes for manipulating dates and times<sup>1</sup>. 
* It then sets a variable to be equal to the weekday number where 0-6 equate to the 7 days of the week (Mon-Sun, with Monday beginning at 0)
* It subsequently gives two printing options when run, depending on the day of the week that the program is run. That it is a weekday if run on Monday to Fri (weekday numbers 0-4) or a weekend if run on Saturday or Sunday (weekday numbers 5 and 6)<sup>2</sup>.

~~~python

# import the 'datetime' module (Ref 1 and 2)
import datetime              
# instruct to get the weekday number (1-7)
weekNumber = datetime.datetime.today().weekday()    

# set the condition to print that it is a weekday 
# if the weeknumber is between 0-4 (i.e Mon-Fri)
if weekNumber < 5:                                  
    print("Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.")
# if it is not between 0-4, print that it is a weekend
else: 
    print("It is the weekend")

## 5. Functions

This week explored functions.

The weekly task was to create a program that takes a floating point number as the input and outputs an approximation of it's square root, without using the in-built functions x**.5 or math.sqrt(x).

#### **squareroot.py**

* This program creates a function to calculate the square root of a number that the user inputs
* The algorithm employed to find the root of the number is Newton's Method<sup>1,2</sup>.

[Newton's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method):
> "...a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function."

* Firstly, the program asks the user to input a positive number.
* It then enters the number into the function, runs it through an equation (x = x - (x multiplied by x minus y) divided by (2 multiplied by x), and it does this 6 times to improve on the accuray of the root output number. 
* It then outputs a sentence that lets the user know what the root value is of the number they chose.

~~~python

# ask the user to input a positive float number
num1 = float(input("Please enter a positive number: "))

# Use Newton's method to write a square root algorithm (Ref 1-2)
# create a function called sqrt 
def sqrt(y: float) -> float:
    x: float = y
    # set a range to run Newton's method equation that follows below 6 times 
    # (6 repeats seems to return a fairly accurate redult. No need to go higher - Ref 2)
    for _ in range (0,6):  
        # Asking: x^2 - y = 0 (y [slope] is a known constant)        
        x = x - (x * x - y) / (2 * x)   
    # call the function
    return x            

# create a new variable equal to the function with the user argument (user inputted float number) inserted into the function
# make sure to include the whole function name here
ans = sqrt(num1) 
# print the new variable, which is the output of the function         
print ("The square root of 14.5 is approx {} ".format (ans))
